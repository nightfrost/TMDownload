# TMDownload
A Python script that fetches metadata and then downloads based on sysargv.

This was made for my work, which means that it will probably not help you a lot. You can always change the handlers and the way it
goes through the JSON.

Example of use:

1. Open CMD
2. CD to directory where download.py is located.
3. Run with: "python download.py 3.2"

3.2 is the version number you want get.

This script currently wont work without a metadata URL, but for obvious reasons I have left that out :)
